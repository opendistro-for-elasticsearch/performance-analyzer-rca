 * <p>But they never the less consume CPU and the Pyrometer has to account for these as part of
 * system CPU. The problem is that if a node is high on shardIndependent CPU, then moving shard
 * around is not going to lessen the node temperature. But these should be accounted for in the
 * destination node where a shard is being placed. If it is already hot because of system CPU,
 * maybe its not a good idea to place a hot shard there.
 *
 * <p>CAVEAT: There are cases where the some of the operations should have been associated with a
 * shard but we are not accounting for them just yet(hopefully we will fix them). So, these CPU
 * percentages will be accounted for in the system CPU, where as they should have been
 * associated with as shard and shard movement would have helped lessen the node temperature.
