  /**
   * This API helps us write any Java Object into the Database and it does not need to be a Graph node anymore.
   * This is required because:
   * - in future we would like to persist 'remediation Actions' and they are not necessarily
   *    FlowUnits or Graph nodes.
   * - This removes de-coupling of the persistence layer from the RCA runtime.
   * Restrictions on the Object
   * --------------------------
   * The Object that can be persisted has certain restrictions:
   * - The Fields of the class that are to be persisted should be annotated with '@ValueColumn' or '@RefColumn'.
   *    A Field should be annotated as @ValueColumn if the field type is a Java primitive type or String type.
   *    The accepted types are boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float, and double and their Boxed counterparts.
   *    A Column can be marked as @RefColumn if the class Field is an user defined Java Class or a collection of the same.
   * - The annotated Fields should have a 'getter' and a 'setter'. getters are expected to be named as 'get' or 'is'
   *     prepended to the _capitalized_ fieldName. And the setters are expected to be named 'set' and the capitalized
   *     field name. The type of the field should match the type of the getter's return type or the setter's argument
   *     type. Remember, int and Integer are two different types. Therefore, if the field is of type 'int' and your
   *     'getter' returns a value of type Integer, you will still get NoSuchMethodException.
   * - The annotated fields and the getter/setters should be declared in the Object and not in a Super class of it.
   * @param object The Object that needs to be persisted.
   * @param <T> The type of the Object.
   * @throws SQLException This is thrown if the underlying DB throws an error.
   * @throws IOException This is thrown in case the DB file rotation fails.
   * @throws IllegalAccessException If the getters and setters of the fields to be persisted are not Public.
   * @throws NoSuchMethodException If getter or setters don't exist with the expected naming convention.
   * @throws InvocationTargetException Invoking the getter or setter throws an exception.
