/**
 * The interfaces are called to read data for a resource by the runtime before calling the operate
 * method on the node, The runtime also calls it after the operate completes and returns the value
 * to persist the results. The write of the persistor is also called by the network interfaces to
 * persist what the remote node sends. The persistor, is adaptor based. It takes in which data-store
 * to persist the data in as mentioned in the rca.conf file. The available data-stores can be files
 * on disk in some format, SQl lite or S3 or anything new we want to persist to tomorrow. Users in
 * OSS can write an adaptor to their favorite data store.
