/**
 * Collator collects and prunes the candidate decisions from each decider so that their impacts are
 * aligned.
 *
 * <p>Decisions can increase or decrease pressure on different key resources on an Elasticsearch
 * node. This is encapsulated in each Action via the {@link ImpactVector}. Since each decider
 * independently evaluates its decision, it is possible to have conflicting ImpactVectors from
 * actions across deciders.
 *
 * <p>The collator prunes them to ensure we only take actions that either increase, or decrease
 * pressure on a particular node's resources. To resolve conflicts, we prefer stability over
 * performance. In order for the above guarantee to work, there should be only one collator instance
 * in an {@link AnalysisGraph}.
