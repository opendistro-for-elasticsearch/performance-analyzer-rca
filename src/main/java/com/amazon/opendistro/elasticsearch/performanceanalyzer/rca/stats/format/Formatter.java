/**
 * A formatter is used to get the final formatted output of an aggregation.
 *
 * <p>The idea is without having to know the internal structure of the aggregator, one should be
 * able to get a formatted result out. When the caller, passes on a formatter to get(), the get
 * internally calls formatNamedValue and formatValue multiple times one for each statistic value per
 * aggregated Measurement. Say, if you are measuring min, max, mean for X and min and max for Y,
 * then internally formatNamedValue or formatvalue will be called five times in total; 3 times for
 * min, max and mean for X and 2 times for min and max.
 *
 * <p>It is upto the implementing class to store the values however it wants.
