 * A UsageBucket is associated with a {@link com.amazon.opendistro.elasticsearch.performanceanalyzer.grpc.Resource}

 *
 * <p>{@link UsageBucket#UNDER_UTILIZED} means that the
 * {@link com.amazon.opendistro.elasticsearch.performanceanalyzer.grpc.Resource} is barely being
 * used at all and may be a good candidate for scaling in.
 *
 * <p>{@link UsageBucket#HEALTHY_WITH_BUFFER} means that the

 * there is room to increase the pressure on this resource if need be.
 *
 * <p>{@link UsageBucket#HEALTHY} means that the
 * {@link com.amazon.opendistro.elasticsearch.performanceanalyzer.grpc.Resource} is in a healthy
 * state. Resources in this bucket should probably be left alone.
 *
 *
 * <p>{@link UsageBucket#UNHEALTHY} means that the
